# Modules

This folder is intentionally empty for v0.1.

Future modules should be isolated feature packs that plug into the core shell through:

1. A route entry point.
2. Optional domain model extension.
3. Optional UI widgets that consume `src/core` state.

Keep modules self-contained and documented.
