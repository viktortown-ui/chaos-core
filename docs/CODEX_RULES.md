# CODEX RULES

For future agents working on Chaos Core:

1. Run quality gates before finalizing: lint, test, build.
2. Keep changes small and intentional (PR-like slices).
3. Do not rewrite unrelated files.
4. Prefer clear naming and straightforward logic over cleverness.
5. Maintain English-only UI and documentation.
