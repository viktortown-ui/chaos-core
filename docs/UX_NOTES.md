# UX_NOTES

- Keep the core loop lightweight: one clear daily check-in action.
- Prioritize readability over density (especially on mobile).
- Preserve fast navigation between feature containers via bottom nav.
- Ensure progression feedback is immediate (XP/level/stat updates after check-in).
- Avoid introducing UI complexity inside `src/core`; domain remains UI-agnostic.
